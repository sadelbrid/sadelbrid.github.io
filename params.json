Collect the notes in the wind and let them tell a story that is open for your own interpretation. This environment is inspired by the musical works of Adam Young, each scene representing a lyrical theme. \"Flight\" isn't a game, but rather an environment. Relax.\r\n</div> \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
